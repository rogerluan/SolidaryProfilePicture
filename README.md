##App Store Description
Probably you've already seen those customised profile pictures that have a semi-transparent image over them, mainly in a specific social network we all know, right?

So now you can create your next profile picture with your own customised image.

Use this utility app to demonstrate your support to great causes like (RED) - fight against AIDS; breast and male cancer awareness campaigns; local political corruption and other civil protests; protest against terrorism attacks; or any other meaningful cause.

Feel free to spread the word (and image)! Feedback is always welcome, please leave a review with your opinion and improvement requests.

##Cutting To The Chase
If you use Facebook, you must've noticed that they're marketing a few campaigns to spread awareness about a certain topic that's currently in the media.
What I've personally seen was to change people's profile pictures to a rainbow flag, to support Gay Pride; French flag, to support France with the terrorism attacks that were hapenning; and more recently there were even soccer-related filters.

Ok, so what?

###The Problem
Facebook provides us the filters that they want us to use, but it's not that straight forward to get to use it, neither customizable. Which leads to less adoption than what would be interesting, possibly because they don't want to see everyone having their profile pictures colorized, or something.

###The Solution

So, that's exactly what this app does: create the profile pictures with a customized filter, easy as 1 2 3.

##Learned Skills
I built the project mainly to learn some technical concepts myself. So far I've learned only 2 of them, but I intend to learn a few more as I walk along the road map.

So far:

- UIActivityViewController
- Discovered the existent image search APIs, and dealed with some of them.


##Road Map

- Improve the search API integrations to add Google Images and Bing, at least. Flickr doesn't suffice the app's needs.
- Create pre-configured campaigns so people can adopt to them more easily.
- Make use of a little Facebook SDK hack to be able to edit the user's profile picture. See: http://stackoverflow.com/a/8126517/4075379
- Improve UI/UX

##Known Bugs

- None - If you find any, please report!

##Changelog

- v1.0
    - First release
    - Using Flickr as web source for images
    - Share images
